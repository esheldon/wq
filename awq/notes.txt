in the require, node name is just called "node" but in the Node object it is
called "host".  We should be consistent, maybe just "host"

And make the matching be

    bycore: require a certain number of cores
    bynode: require a certain number of nodes
    byhost: require exact hostname match


When matching by host and by node, how many cores will we use by *default*?
All or one?  By defaulting to all we we don't have to know ahead of time how
many cores the nodes have.  Currently defaulting to None.
