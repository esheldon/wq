in the require, node name is just called "node" but in the Node object it is
called "host".  We should be consistent, maybe just "host"

And make the matching be

    bycore: require a certain number of cores on any node
    bynode: require a certain number of full nodes 
    byhost: require exact hostname match and get full node back
    bygrp: requires a full (single) group of nodes


When matching by host and by node, how many cores will we use by *default*?
All or one?  


By defaulting to all we we don't have to know ahead of time how
many cores the nodes have.  Currently defaulting to None.
