in the require, node name is just called "node" but in the Node object it is
called "host".  We should be consistent, maybe just "host"

And make the matching be

Compulsory arguments denoted by (*)

* bycore: require a certain number of cores on any node
  Options: in_group, not_in_group, N
  Nodes must be in_group if specified
  Nodes should not be in not_in_group if specified
  We allocate a total of N cores, default = 1

* bycore1: rquires a certain number of cores on a single node
  Options: in_group, not_in_group, N
  Nodes must be in_group if specified
  Nodes should not be in not_in_group if specified
  We allocate a total of N cores demand them to be on the same 
  node, default = 1

* bynode: require a certain number of full nodes 
  Options: in_group, not_in_group, N, min_cores
  Nodes must be in_group if specified
  Nodes should not be in not_in_group if specified
  We allocate a total of N nodes, default = 1
  Each node must have at least min_cores total cores.
  We never match a partially loaded nodes, we always demans full nodes

* byhost: require exact hostname match 
  Options: host (*) , N
  We demand N cores on host host.

* bygrp: requires a full (single) group of nodes
  Options: group (*)
  We demans the entire group group. 
  All nodes must be completelly free on that group for a match
